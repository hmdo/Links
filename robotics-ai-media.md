INTUITION ROBOTICS – ELLIQ (Robot & Ipad )
We first introduced you to ELLI•Q from Israeli-based Intuition Robotics in our feature on seven cool robots earlier this year. Since then, the startup has taken in a ton more money to bring total funding to $20 million. Backers include Toyota AI Ventures, one of the many emerging VC funds focused on artificial intelligence. ELLI•Q is sort of like what we imagined Siri would actually be like by now. The company, founded in 2015, describes the miniature robot as an “active aging companion” that provides stimulation through online games and video chats, as well as a way to help older folks navigate the complexities of the digital age. ELLI•Q also keeps an eye on its owner by suggesting physical activities to avoid spending too much time in front of the TV, as well as reminding him or her about appointments or when to take medication. Using machine learning, she learns the preferences, behaviour and personality of her owner. That’s better than some couples who have been married for 50 years.
